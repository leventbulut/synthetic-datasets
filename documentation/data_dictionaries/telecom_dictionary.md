## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values (MNAR - 3%)
- **Missingness Pattern**: Higher missingness in `satisfaction_score` for customers with low usage
- **Business Logic**: Low-usage customers may not provide satisfaction feedback

### Outliers (0.2%)
- **Usage Outliers**: Extremely high data usage (>1000 GB) or voice minutes (>10000)
- **Age Outliers**: Unrealistic customer ages (<13 or >100)
- **Cost Outliers**: Very high monthly charges (>$500) or negative values
- **Score Outliers**: Perfect scores (10.0) or extremely low scores (<1.0)

### Entry Errors (â‰¤30%)
- **Usage Errors**: Some customers show impossible usage patterns
- **Date Errors**: Future service start dates or impossible sequences
- **Cost Errors**: Negative charges or inconsistent pricing
- **Behavior Errors**: Inconsistent customer behavior patterns

## Target Variable Dependencies

### Customer Churn (Classification)
Depends on:
1. **customer_service_calls** - Primary predictor (positive correlation with churn)
2. **complaint_count** - Higher complaints increase churn risk
3. **satisfaction_score** - Lower satisfaction increases churn risk
4. **call_drop_rate** - Poor network quality increases churn risk
5. **resolution_time_hours** - Longer resolution times increase churn risk
6. **late_payment_count** - Payment issues indicate churn risk

### Satisfaction Score (Regression)
Depends on:
1. **network_coverage_score** - Better coverage improves satisfaction
2. **data_speed_score** - Faster speeds increase satisfaction
3. **service_reliability** - More reliable service improves satisfaction
4. **billing_accuracy_score** - Accurate billing increases satisfaction
5. **resolution_time_hours** - Faster issue resolution improves satisfaction
6. **customer_service_calls** - Fewer service calls indicate higher satisfaction

## Data Generation Notes
- **Seed**: Randomized for novelty
- **Distributions**: Realistic telecommunications industry patterns
- **Seasonality**: None (static snapshot)
- **Correlations**: Maintains realistic telecom relationships
