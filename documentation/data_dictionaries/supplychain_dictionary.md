## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values (MNAR - 3%)
- **Missingness Pattern**: Higher missingness in `quality_inspection_score` for low-value transactions
- **Business Logic**: Smaller orders may not undergo full quality inspection

### Outliers (0.2%)
- **Cost Outliers**: Extremely high unit prices (>$10k) or order quantities (>100k units)
- **Quality Outliers**: Perfect quality scores (100%) or extremely low scores (<10%)
- **Lead Time Outliers**: Negative lead times or extremely long lead times (>365 days)

### Entry Errors (â‰¤30%)
- **Date Errors**: Some delivery dates before order dates
- **Quantity Errors**: Negative order quantities or unrealistic values
- **Cost Errors**: Negative costs or inconsistent pricing

## Target Variable Dependencies

### Supplier Risk Level (Classification)
Depends on:
1. **defect_rate** - Primary predictor (positive correlation with risk)
2. **delivery_performance_score** - Poor delivery performance increases risk
3. **compliance_score** - Low compliance increases risk
4. **return_rate** - High return rates indicate risk
5. **supplier_rating** - Low supplier ratings increase risk
6. **years_in_business** - Newer suppliers may have higher risk

### Total Cost (Regression)
Depends on:
1. **unit_price** - Primary cost driver
2. **order_quantity** - Higher quantities affect total cost
3. **shipping_cost** - Distance and delivery method impact
4. **handling_cost** - Product characteristics affect handling
5. **supplier_location** - Geographic factors influence costs
6. **product_quality_grade** - Higher quality may command premium pricing
