## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values (MNAR - 3%)
- **Missingness Pattern**: Higher missingness in `payment_history_score` for customers with poor credit scores
- **Business Logic**: Customers with low credit scores may have incomplete payment histories

### Outliers (0.2%)
- **Income Outliers**: Very high income values (>$500k) and very low income values (<$5k)
- **Credit Score Outliers**: Extremely low scores (<300) and perfect scores (850)
- **Debt Outliers**: Unusually high debt-to-income ratios (>10)

### Entry Errors (â‰¤30%)
- **Age Errors**: Some customers show unrealistic ages (<18 or >100)
- **Income Errors**: Inconsistent income levels vs. employment status
- **Date Errors**: Some future dates in customer_since field

## Target Variable Dependencies

### Credit Risk Level (Classification)
Depends on:
1. **credit_score** - Primary predictor (negative correlation)
2. **debt_to_income_ratio** - High ratio increases risk
3. **payment_history_score** - Poor payment history increases risk
4. **credit_utilization** - High utilization indicates risk
5. **late_payments_90d** - Recent late payments increase risk
6. **income_level** - Lower income associated with higher risk

### Fraud Risk Score (Regression)
Depends on:
1. **recent_inquiries** - Multiple inquiries may indicate fraud
2. **payment_history_score** - Sudden changes in payment behavior
3. **credit_utilization** - Unusual utilization patterns
4. **account_age_months** - New accounts may have higher fraud risk
5. **income_level** vs **credit_limit** - Mismatch may indicate fraud
