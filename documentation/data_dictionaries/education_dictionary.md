## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values (MNAR - 3%)
- **Missingness Pattern**: Higher missingness in `satisfaction_score` for students with low academic performance
- **Business Logic**: Struggling students may not complete all assessments

### Outliers (0.2%)
- **Score Outliers**: Perfect scores (100%) or extremely low scores (<10%)
- **Age Outliers**: Unrealistic student ages (<13 or >20)
- **Time Outliers**: Negative study hours or impossible attendance rates
- **GPA Outliers**: GPAs above 4.0 or negative values

### Entry Errors (â‰¤30%)
- **Score Errors**: Some students show inconsistent performance across subjects
- **Date Errors**: Future enrollment dates or impossible grade sequences
- **Value Errors**: Negative scores or impossible percentages
- **Demographic Errors**: Inconsistent demographic information

## Target Variable Dependencies

### Academic Performance Level (Classification)
Depends on:
1. **gpa** - Primary predictor (positive correlation)
2. **overall_academic_score** - Higher scores indicate better performance
3. **study_hours_per_week** - More study time improves performance
4. **homework_completion_rate** - Higher completion rates improve performance
5. **class_attendance_rate** - Better attendance improves performance
6. **family_income** - Higher income associated with better performance

### College Readiness Score (Regression)
Depends on:
1. **overall_academic_score** - Primary predictor
2. **gpa** - Higher GPA increases readiness
3. **standardized_test_scores** - Better test scores indicate readiness
4. **study_hours_per_week** - More study time improves readiness
5. **extracurricular_activities** - Well-rounded students have higher readiness
6. **family_support_score** - Family support improves readiness
