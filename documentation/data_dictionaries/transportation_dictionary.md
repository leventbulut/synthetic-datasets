## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values (MNAR - 3%)
- **Missingness Pattern**: Higher missingness in `customer_satisfaction` for failed deliveries
- **Business Logic**: Failed deliveries may not receive customer feedback

### Outliers (0.2%)
- **Distance Outliers**: Extremely long routes (>1000 miles) or negative distances
- **Cost Outliers**: Very high costs (>$1000) or negative costs
- **Time Outliers**: Negative travel times or extremely long times
- **Weight Outliers**: Extremely heavy packages (>1000 lbs) or negative weights

### Entry Errors (â‰¤30%)
- **Date Errors**: Actual delivery dates before scheduled dates
- **Time Errors**: Negative travel times or impossible sequences
- **Cost Errors**: Negative costs or inconsistent calculations
- **Route Errors**: Impossible route combinations

## Target Variable Dependencies

### Delivery Success (Classification)
Depends on:
1. **weather_condition** - Primary predictor (adverse weather reduces success)
2. **traffic_conditions** - Poor traffic reduces success
3. **driver_rating** - Higher driver ratings improve success
4. **vehicle_condition** - Better vehicle condition improves success
5. **route_distance** - Longer routes may reduce success
6. **delivery_priority** - Higher priority improves success

### Delivery Cost (Regression)
Depends on:
1. **route_distance** - Primary cost driver
2. **fuel_cost** - Distance and fuel efficiency affect cost
3. **labor_cost** - Travel time affects labor cost
4. **vehicle_maintenance_cost** - Vehicle type and condition affect cost
5. **package_weight** - Heavier packages increase cost
6. **delivery_priority** - Priority services increase cost

## Data Generation Notes
- **Seed**: Randomized for novelty
- **Distributions**: Realistic transportation industry patterns
- **Seasonality**: None (static snapshot)
- **Correlations**: Maintains realistic transportation relationships
