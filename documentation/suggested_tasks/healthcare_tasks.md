# Suggested Analytical Tasks - Healthcare Dataset

## Classification Tasks

### 1. Readmission Risk Prediction
**Objective**: Predict which patients are at high risk of readmission within 30 days.

**Target Variable**: `readmission_risk` (0=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High)

**Key Features**: Age, length of stay, comorbidity count, primary diagnosis, insurance type, vital signs, lab values

**Business Impact**: Early identification of high-risk patients enables targeted interventions, reducing readmission rates by 15-25%.

**Suggested Approaches**:
- Multi-class classification with class imbalance handling
- Feature importance analysis for clinical decision-making
- Model interpretability techniques (SHAP, LIME) for medical staff
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) for robust predictions

**Evaluation Metrics**: F1-score (weighted), Precision-Recall curves, Confusion matrices

### 2. Patient Outcome Classification
**Objective**: Classify patients into risk categories based on clinical indicators.

**Target Variable**: Create a composite risk score combining multiple factors

**Key Features**: Vital signs, lab values, age, comorbidities, admission type

**Business Impact**: Helps prioritize care resources and identify patients needing intensive monitoring.

## Regression Tasks

### 3. Hospital Cost Forecasting
**Objective**: Predict total hospitalization costs for individual patients.

**Target Variable**: `total_cost` (continuous, skewed distribution)

**Key Features**: Length of stay, hospital department, primary diagnosis, age, insurance type, comorbidity count

**Business Impact**: Accurate cost prediction enables better financial planning, insurance negotiations, and resource allocation.

**Suggested Approaches**:
- Handle skewed distribution with log transformation or quantile regression
- Feature engineering for cost drivers (LOS × department multipliers)
- Time series analysis for seasonal cost patterns
- Ensemble regression methods for robust predictions

**Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R², Mean Absolute Percentage Error

### 4. Length of Stay Prediction
**Objective**: Forecast how long patients will remain hospitalized.

**Target Variable**: `length_of_stay` (integer, exponential distribution)

**Key Features**: Age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission type, initial vital signs

**Business Impact**: Better capacity planning and resource allocation across hospital departments.

## Clustering Tasks

### 5. Patient Segmentation
**Objective**: Identify distinct patient groups for targeted care strategies.

**Clustering Variables**: Age, comorbidity count, diagnosis category, insurance type, cost patterns

**Business Impact**: Personalized care pathways, resource optimization, and population health management.

**Suggested Approaches**:
- K-means clustering with optimal K selection
- Hierarchical clustering for interpretable patient hierarchies
- DBSCAN for identifying outlier patient groups
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (PCA)

**Use Cases**:
- High-cost, high-risk patient identification
- Insurance-specific care pathway development
- Department-specific resource allocation

### 6. Department Performance Clustering
**Objective**: Group hospital departments by performance characteristics.

**Clustering Variables**: Average LOS, readmission rates, cost per patient, patient demographics

**Business Impact**: Identify best practices and areas for improvement across departments.

## Advanced Analytics Tasks

### 7. Time Series Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze seasonal patterns in admissions, costs, and outcomes.

**Time Variables**: `admission_date`, `discharge_date`

**Business Impact**: Seasonal staffing and resource planning, capacity management.

**Suggested Approaches**:
- Seasonal decomposition of time series
- ARIMA models for admission forecasting
- Anomaly detection in admission patterns
- Correlation analysis with external factors

### 8. Feature Engineering and Selection
**Objective**: Create new predictive features and identify the most important ones.

**Suggested Features**:
- Risk scores combining multiple variables
- Interaction terms (age × diagnosis, LOS × department)
- Temporal features (day of week, month, season)
- Clinical ratios (systolic/diastolic BP, cost per day)

**Business Impact**: Improved model performance and clinical interpretability.

## Data Quality and Preprocessing Challenges

### 9. Missing Data Handling
**Challenge**: 3% missingness with MNAR patterns
**Tasks**:
- Analyze missing data patterns
- Implement appropriate imputation strategies
- Evaluate impact on model performance

### 10. Outlier Detection and Treatment
**Challenge**: 0.2% outliers representing data entry errors
**Tasks**:
- Identify and characterize outliers
- Develop outlier treatment strategies
- Assess impact on model robustness

## Implementation Guidelines

### Data Splitting Strategy
- **Training**: 70% (350,000 records)
- **Validation**: 15% (75,000 records) 
- **Testing**: 15% (75,000 records)

### Cross-Validation
- Use stratified K-fold for classification tasks
- Time-based splitting for regression tasks
- Ensure no data leakage between train/validation/test sets

### Model Deployment Considerations
- Model interpretability for clinical staff
- Real-time prediction capabilities
- Model monitoring and retraining schedules
- Integration with hospital information systems

## Success Metrics

**Classification Tasks**: F1-score > 0.75, Precision > 0.80 for high-risk class
**Regression Tasks**: R² > 0.60, MAPE < 20%
**Clustering Tasks**: Silhouette score > 0.3, clinically meaningful clusters

These tasks provide comprehensive practice in healthcare analytics while addressing real-world challenges that healthcare organizations face daily.
