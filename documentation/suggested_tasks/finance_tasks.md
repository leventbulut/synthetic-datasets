## 4. Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

### Objective
Estimate the long-term value of customers based on current financial behavior and characteristics.

### Target Variable
- **Primary**: Predicted customer value (regression)
- **Secondary**: Customer value tier (classification)

### Key Features
- **Current Value**: `annual_income`, `credit_limit`, `total_debt`
- **Behavior**: `payment_history_score`, `credit_utilization`, `account_age`
